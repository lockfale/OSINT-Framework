# OSINT Framework v.2

http://osintframework.com

## Notes
OSINT framework v.2 focused on gathering information from free tools or resources. The intention is to help people find free OSINT resources. Some sites included might require registration or offer more data for $$$, but you should be able to get at least a portion of the available information for no cost.

I originally created this framework with an information security point of view. Since then, the response from other fields and disciplines has been incredible. I would love to be able to include any other OSINT resources, especially from fields outside of infosec. Please let me know about anything that might be missing!

Compared to version 1, the framework has been significantly changed structurally and supplemented, in particular, the resource base from Bellingcat (https://ru.bellingcat.com/) has been completely introduced into it, a large number of different utilities and links have been added, all inaccessible and non-working resources have been removed, resource descriptions have been added, the legend has been changed, coloring of branches has been added, search and more.

Please visit the framework at the link below and good hunting!

### Contribute with a GitHub Pull Request
For new resources, please ensure that the site is available for public and free use.
<ol start="1">
  <li>Update the arf.json file in the format shown below. If this isn't the first entry for a folder, add a comma to the last closing brace of the previous entry.</li>
</ol>

```
{
  "name": "Example Name",
  "type": "url",
  "url": "http://example.com",
  "description": "Service description",
  "color": "red",
  "guides": [
    {
      "name": "Guide 1"
      "url": "https://example-guides.com/guide1.html"
    },
    {
      "name": "Guide 2",
      "url": "https://example-guides.com/guide2.pdf"
    }
  ]
}
```
'type' field can take 'folder' or 'url' values. 'description' and 'color' fields are not required.
'guides' field are not required so.

For some resources in languages other than English, language designations are used: (China) / (CH), Russian / (RU), French / (FR), etc.
